description: Practical workflows and a tour of the Obby UI
---

This guide shows how to use Obby day‑to‑day: where everything is in the UI, how to run common workflows, and the small rules that make the sandbox flow reliable.

## UI Tour

### Header and Tabs
- The app opens to the Chat view.
- On small screens, use the tab bar to switch between:
  - Chat
  - Preview
  - File Explorer
  - Logs
- On large screens, Chat is on the left and the other panels stack on the right.

### Chat
- This is where you type prompts and watch the agent work.
- The assistant streams reasoning (when available) and tool activity such as sandbox creation, file uploads, commands, and preview URLs.
- Tip: Try the built‑in test prompts for a quick demo:
  - “Generate a Next.js app that allows to list and search Pokemons”
  - “Create a `golang` server that responds with "Hello World" to any request”

### Models
- Click “Models” to:
  - Pick a provider and model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, OpenRouter, Vercel, Gateway, Bedrock).
  - Optionally add your own API key (BYOK).
- BYOK models are clearly marked.
- Keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl + . to open the model selector.

### Tool Options
- The “Tools” button toggles optional capabilities:
  - Web Scrape (Firecrawl)
  - Web Search (Firecrawl)
- Enable them when your task needs live web content.
- Requires `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` in environment.

### Preview
- “Web” tab: live iframe of your running app with refresh and “open in new tab.”
- “Code” tab: an embedded File Explorer for quick browsing and syntax‑highlighted views.

### File Explorer
- Browse generated files in a tree.
- Click a file to view its content with syntax highlighting.
- On desktop, also accessible under Preview → Code tab.

### Logs
- Streams command logs (stdout/stderr) line‑by‑line.
- Shows exit codes once a command completes.

## Common Workflows

### 1) New Project From Scratch
1. Create Sandbox
   - The agent will create a single fresh environment.
   - Expose the dev server port you’ll need (e.g., 3000).
2. Generate Files
   - Ask the agent to scaffold an app. It writes complete, runnable files.
3. Install → Wait
   - Run Command: `pnpm install`
   - Wait Command: until it finishes with exit code 0.
4. Dev Server (long‑running)
   - Run Command: `pnpm run dev` (do not wait; it stays running).
5. Preview
   - Get Sandbox URL for the exposed port (e.g., 3000).
   - Open the URL or use the Preview panel.
6. Iterate
   - Ask the agent to add features or fix issues; it will generate/modify files.
   - For Next.js, run the dev server once—HMR handles file updates.

### 2) Fix a Build Error
1. Check Logs
   - Identify the missing file/config or exact error message.
2. Generate Files
   - Ask the agent to create or update the specific file(s).
3. Rebuild → Wait
   - Run Command: `pnpm build`
   - Wait Command: confirm exit code 0.
4. Preview
   - Start the dev server if needed, then refresh the Preview.

### 3) Research‑Assisted Build
1. Enable Tools
   - Toggle Web Search/Scrape in Tool Options.
2. Search
   - Ask: “Find latest docs/examples for `topic`” to get links and summaries.
3. Scrape
   - Ask: “Scrape this page for markdown + summary” for a specific URL.
4. Implement
   - Use the findings to generate files or adjust code, then run and preview.

## Model & Key Management

- Providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, OpenRouter, Vercel (v0), Gateway, Bedrock.
- BYOK:
  - Add a token per provider (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.).
  - For Bedrock, supply region + AWS credentials.
- Availability:
  - Some models are BYOK‑only. Others can use app‑level keys.
- You can switch providers/models anytime; the agent adapts accordingly.

---

## Tips & Rules for Reliability

- Single Sandbox
  - One sandbox per session; reuse it unless you explicitly reset.
- Stateless Commands
  - Each “Run Command” is a fresh shell session.
  - Avoid `cd`, `&&`, and shell state. Use full relative paths instead.
- Sequence With “Wait”
  - Always wait after installs/builds before running dependent steps.
- Prefer pnpm
  - The sandbox has pnpm; use it for installs and scripts.
- Expose Ports Up Front
  - You can only preview ports that were exposed during sandbox creation.
  - Note: Port 8080 is reserved; use a different port (e.g., 3000, 5173, 8000).
- Web Tools
  - Enable only if needed; set `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` in your environment.

## Example: Next.js App in Minutes

1. Prompt:
   - “Create a Next.js app with a `/todos` route that lists items and supports adding new ones.”
2. Agent flow:
   - Create Sandbox (expose 3000)
   - Generate Files (scaffold Next.js + route + UI)
   - Run Command: `pnpm install` → Wait
   - Run Command: `pnpm run dev`
   - Get Sandbox URL (port 3000)
3. Preview and iterate:
   - Open the URL, verify it works.
   - Ask the agent to add validation/tests or persist data.

## Troubleshooting

- “Model not available”
  - Pick a provider and add a valid API key for BYOK models.
- “No preview URL”
  - Ensure the port was exposed at sandbox creation and the server is running.
- “Command failed”
  - Read the Logs for the error.
  - Fix via Generate Files or adjust commands, then try again.
- “Web tools error”
  - Set `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` and re‑enable in Tool Options.
