title: Obby — Overview & Quickstart
description: Features, setup, and usage for the Obby coding agent and docs
---

Welcome to Obby. Obby is a full‑stack coding agent powered by Vercel AI SDK, AI Gateway, and Vercel Sandbox, shipped in a Turbo monorepo. This docs site is built with Fumadocs.

## Quickstart

1. Clone and install
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eersnington/obby-dev
   cd obby-dev
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Configure environment for the app at `apps/obby`
   - Copy the example file and fill in values:
     ```bash
     cp apps/obby/.env.example apps/obby/.env.local
     ```
   - Required keys to run core features:
     - Server: `DATABASE_URL`
     - Client: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL=http://localhost:3001`
     - Optional AI Providers (BYOK): `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
     - Bedrock (optional): `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`
     - Web tools (optional): `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`
     - Vercel Sandbox: `VERCEL_TEAM_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `VERCEL_TOKEN`

3. Run the monorepo in dev mode
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   - App: http://localhost:3000
   - Docs: http://localhost:3001

## Using Obby

- Open the app at http://localhost:3000
- Pick a model and (optionally) set your own provider API key in the “Models” UI
- Start chatting. The agent will orchestrate tools to build and run projects inside a Vercel Sandbox

### Key Features

- Models & Providers
  - Providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, OpenRouter, Vercel, Gateway, Bedrock
  - BYOK support with per‑provider key inputs; Bedrock supports region + access keys

- Chat Orchestration & Tools
  - Create Sandbox: starts an ephemeral Linux environment (expose ports you’ll need)
  - Generate Files: creates files directly in the sandbox (scaffolds apps, adds features)
  - Run Command: runs commands asynchronously (stateless; use full paths; prefer pnpm)
  - Wait Command: waits for command completion; required for sequential workflows
  - Get Sandbox URL: returns a public preview URL for an exposed port
  - Web Scrape / Web Search: Firecrawl‑powered enrichment (requires `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`)

- Preview, Files, and Logs
  - Web Preview: live app preview with reload
  - File Explorer: browse generated files and view content with syntax highlighting
  - Logs Panel: streamed command logs and exit codes

- Helpful Starters
  - Try the built‑in test prompts on the Chat screen to scaffold and run sample apps

## Typical Workflow

1. Create Sandbox (expose the dev server port, e.g., 3000)
2. Generate Files (scaffold the project)
3. Run Command → Wait Command (e.g., `pnpm install`, then `pnpm run dev`)
4. Get Sandbox URL (preview the running app)
5. Iterate with more file generation and commands

## Troubleshooting

- “Model not available”: ensure you’ve selected a provider and added a valid API key (BYOK), or configure app‑level keys in `.env.local`
- No preview URL: the port must be exposed during sandbox creation, and the server must be running
- Firecrawl errors: set `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`
- Commands failing: commands are stateless; avoid `cd`, use full relative paths, and use “Wait Command” before dependent steps
- Prefer `pnpm` over `npm` for installs and scripts in the sandbox
