description: Comprehensive overview of Obby’s capabilities, tools, and UI
---

Obby is a full‑stack coding agent that builds and runs apps inside an ephemeral, isolated Vercel Sandbox. It orchestrates models and tools through the Vercel AI SDK and Gateway, with a first‑class developer UI for previewing, file browsing, and logs.

## At a Glance

- Multi‑provider model support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, OpenRouter, Vercel, Gateway, Bedrock)
- Bring‑Your‑Own‑Key (BYOK) with per‑provider configuration
- Single‑session Vercel Sandbox for file generation and command execution
- Web preview, file explorer with syntax highlighting, and live command logs
- Optional Firecrawl‑powered web scrape and web search tools
- Built with Next.js App Router and Fumadocs

---

## Core Concepts

- Single sandbox per session
  - You work in one ephemeral environment per chat session.
  - Expose ports during sandbox creation to preview servers later.
- Stateless commands
  - Each command runs in a fresh shell session; do not rely on `cd` or shell state.
  - Use full relative paths and sequence dependent commands with “Wait Command.”
- Prefer pnpm
  - The sandbox has pnpm available; use pnpm for installs and scripts.
- BYOK and access rules
  - Some models require your own key (BYOK).
  - Bedrock supports region + credentials; other providers use token keys.

---

## Models & Providers

Obby ships with an opinionated set of providers and model metadata. You can pick a provider and model in the UI and (optionally) attach your own API key.

- Providers
  - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, OpenRouter, Vercel (v0), Gateway, Bedrock (AWS)
- BYOK
  - Token‑based: e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
  - AWS Bedrock: `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (+ optional session token)
- Availability
  - Models marked “BYOK” in the UI require your key.
  - Gateway/OpenRouter proxy models when supported; local app keys can also be configured.

Tip: Use the Model Selector to choose provider/model and set a user‑level key without restarting the app.

## Agent Tools

Obby’s agent uses a small, reliable set of tools. They’re invoked in sequence by the chat orchestration logic based on your prompt.

### 1) Create Sandbox
- Initializes a fresh Amazon Linux 2023 environment.
- Expose ports up front (e.g., `[3000]`) for dev servers you want to preview.
- Use once per session unless you explicitly need a reset.

When to use: New project, environment reset, or if you need a clean slate.

### 2) Generate Files
- Creates or updates files directly inside the sandbox.
- Produces complete, runnable files (scaffolds apps, adds routes/components/config).
- Paths must be relative to the sandbox root (e.g., `package.json`, `src/index.ts`).

When to use: Scaffolding, adding features, writing missing config, or fixing build errors caused by missing files.

### 3) Run Command
- Starts a command asynchronously and returns a `commandId`.
- Commands are stateless; don’t chain with `&&` or rely on previous `cd`.
- Prefer `pnpm` for installs and scripts.

Examples:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
pnpm build
```

### 4) Wait Command
- Blocks until a previously started command finishes.
- Required for sequential workflows (e.g., install → build → start).

Best practice:
1) Run Command: `pnpm install`
2) Wait Command (expect exit code 0)
3) Run Command: `pnpm run dev` (long‑running, typically do not wait)

### 5) Get Sandbox URL
- Returns a public URL for a port exposed during sandbox creation.
- Only works if the server is running on that port.

Use after `pnpm run dev` to preview the app.

### 6) Web Scrape (optional)
- Single‑page scrape via Firecrawl with markdown, summary, and/or screenshot.
- Requires `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`.

### 7) Web Search (optional)
- Firecrawl search across web (and GitHub category).
- Useful for quick research, fact‑checking, or pulling docs links.
- Requires `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`.

## Developer UI

- Chat
  - Send prompts, see reasoning (when provided), and structured tool activity messages.
  - Try sample prompts to scaffold apps quickly.
- Model Selector
  - Choose provider/model, mark BYOK models, and store per‑provider keys.
- Tool Options
  - Toggle optional tools (Web Scrape, Web Search) per session.
- Preview
  - Web tab: live iframe preview with reload and “open in new tab.”
  - Code tab: embedded file explorer for browsing and reading generated files.
- File Explorer
  - Tree view with syntax highlighting; auto‑refreshes content from the sandbox.
- Logs
  - Streams command logs and shows exit codes on completion.

---

## Typical Workflow

1. Create Sandbox (expose e.g., `3000`)
2. Generate Files (scaffold project)
3. Run Command: `pnpm install` → Wait Command
4. Run Command: `pnpm run dev` (keep running)
5. Get Sandbox URL (preview)
6. Iterate: generate more files, run tests/builds, repeat

## Environment & Integrations

- Required (app)
  - App URLs: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL`
  - Database (if used): `DATABASE_URL`
- Optional (AI providers)
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`
- Optional (AWS Bedrock)
  - `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN?`
- Optional (Web tools)
  - `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`
- Vercel Sandbox
  - `VERCEL_TEAM_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `VERCEL_TOKEN`

Never commit secrets. Use a local `.env.local` and your preferred secret manager in production.

---

## Reliability & Safety

- Bot protection enabled on chat API route.
- Structured error logging with robust, typed validation.
- Commands are isolated per run to reduce side‑effects.
- File generation is streamed with progress feedback and path tracking.

---

## Limitations & Tips

- Expose ports during sandbox creation; you cannot expose new ports later.
- Commands are stateless—avoid `cd` and shell state assumptions.
- Only one sandbox per session unless you explicitly reset.
- Prefer `pnpm` for consistency with the sandbox environment.
- Web tools require `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`.
